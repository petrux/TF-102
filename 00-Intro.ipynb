    "# TensorFlow Tutorial\n",
    "This set of notebooks are intended to cover some basic topics about TensorFlow (TF) usage. This tutorial is intended to be something more than a `TF 101` (let,s say `TF >101`) as we assume that the reader already is somehow familiar with the idea of a computational graph. That's why any description about the basic algebra won't be covered and its left to the official documentation. Here follows a ideal outline for a full `TF` tutorial. Some of such topics are covered in this tutorial and links to the proper material will be provided.\n",
